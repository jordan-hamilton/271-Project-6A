; Project Number: 6                Due Date: 3/17/2019
; Description: This program prompts the user to enter a number of integers in the range [10, 200], then generates that many
; random integers between 100 and 999 to store in an array. The numbers are displayed to the user, then the list is sorted in
; descending order and the median value. is calculated and displayed to the user. Finally, the user is shown the same list again
; after sorting.
